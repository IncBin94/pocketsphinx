{"name":"Pocketsphinx","tagline":"PocketSphinx is a lightweight speech recognition engine, specifically tuned for handheld and mobile devices, though it works equally well on the desktop","body":"PocketSphinx 5prealpha\r\n\r\nThis is PocketSphinx, one of Carnegie Mellon University's open source\r\nlarge vocabulary, speaker-independent continuous speech recognition\r\nengine. Please see the LICENSE file for terms of use.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A RESEARCH SYSTEM.  This is also an early release of a\r\nresearch system.  We know the APIs and function names are likely to\r\nchange, and that several tools need to be made available to make this\r\nall complete.  With your help and contributions, this can progress in\r\nresponse to the needs and patches provided.\r\n\r\nTo compile:\r\n\r\nFirst, you *must* have SphinxBase, which you can download from\r\nhttp://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/.  You should download and unpack it to\r\nthe same parent directory as PocketSphinx, so that the configure script\r\nand project files can find it. On Windows, you will need to rename\r\n'sphinxbase-X.Y' (where X.Y is the SphinxBase version number) to simply\r\n'sphinxbase' for this to work.\r\n\r\nIn a unix-like environment (such as linux, solaris etc):\r\n\r\n * build and optionally install SphinxBase.  If you want to use\r\n   fixed-point arithmetic, you *must* configure SphinxBase with the\r\n   --enable-fixed option.\r\n\r\n * if you downloaded directly from the CVS repository, you need to do\r\n   this at least once to generate the \"configure\" file:\r\n\r\n% ./autogen.sh\r\n\r\n * if you downloaded the release version, or ran \"autogen.sh\" at least\r\n   once, then compile and install:\r\n\r\n% ./configure\r\n% make clean all\r\n% make test\r\n% make install\r\n\r\nXCode Installation (for iPhone):\r\n\r\nSphinxbase uses the standard unix autogen system, and there's a script\r\nincluded, 'build_for_iphone.sh' that will setup configure to create\r\nbinaries that are XCode friendly.\r\n\r\n1) ./autogen.sh\r\n2) ./build_for_iphone.sh simulator\r\n3) ./build_for_iphone.sh device\r\n\r\nThen in XCode, open your project info, and for 'All Configurations', and\r\nset:\r\n\r\n'Header Search Paths' = \"$(HOME)$(SDK_DIR)/include/pocketsphinx\"\r\n'Library Search Paths' = \"$(HOME)$(SDK_DIR)/lib\"\r\n'Other Linker Flags' = \"-lpocketsphinx\"\r\n\r\nIn MS Windows (TM), under MS Visual Studio 2010 (or newer - we test\r\nwith Visual C++ 2010 Express):\r\n\r\n * load sphinxbase.sln located in sphinxbase directory\r\n\r\n * compile all the projects in SphinxBase (from sphinxbase.sln)\r\n\r\n * load pocketsphinx.sln in pocketsphinx directory\r\n\r\n * compile all the projects in PocketSphinx\r\n\r\nMS Visual Studio will build the executables under .\\bin\\Release or\r\n.\\bin\\Debug (depending on the version you choose on MS Visual Studio),\r\nand the libraries under .\\lib\\Release or .\\lib\\Build.\r\n\r\nTest scripts are forthcoming for Windows.\r\n\r\nFor up-to-date information, see http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
